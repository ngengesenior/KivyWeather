Kivy Weather
------------
------------
This is a sample application that I wrote that uses a query from Yahoo weather
Api which can be found at [this link](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/).
The app uses Kivy for the GUI display and for installing Kivy on your PC,
check [the kivy website](https://www.kivy.org).
The app requires internet connction as well.
